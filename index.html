The International Society for Labor and Social Security Law (ISLSSL) is composed of national affiliates (Branches) whose members are scholars, union and management lawyers, judges, government officials, arbitrators, industrial relations and human resources specialists, and others interested in promoting international exchange of ideas and information and in developing collaboration among experts in the fields of labor, employment and employee benefits law.   
<br /><br />
The ISLSSL conducts a World Congress every three years and Regional Congresses (open to registrants from all regions) during the interim years. These meetings allow members both to combine travel with expanded understanding of how labor and employment law operate elsewhere and explain our system to others. ISLSSL conferences also facilitate development of new personal contacts and promote important scholarship, education and training in the fields of comparative and international labor law, employment law, and related fields. 
<br /><br />
As a special activity, the U.S. Branch sponsors the Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal, the preeminent scholarly journal in this field. Membership in the U.S. Branch includes membership in the international body as well as a subscription to the Journal. In addition, twice yearly the Branch distributes its Bulletin describing member activities, upcoming meetings and other news. 
<br /><br />
The most recent World Congresses were held in Cape Town, South Africa (2015); Santiago, Chile (2012); and Sydney, Australia (2009). The most recent regional Congresses were held in Dublin, Ireland (2014); Guayaquil, Ecuador (2013); and Cartagena de Indias, Columbia (2011). The United States Branch also sponsors academic seminars. The most recent seminar sponsored by the United States Branch was held at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in 2015. The topic was Crowd-Sourcing and the Law and the papers will be published in the Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal.
